Try to keep this up to date:

(0) May need to tune constraint-dropping.
(1) Need AP scores.
(2) Need SPL, SPL+, SPL++.
(3) Need more graceful handling of user input.
(4) Need more elegant way to decide which application to use (currently ExampleLoader.py does this with an if-block; maybe could use something like exec("import " + var + " as App"), where var is set by the user input).
(5) Maybe could move more code from ImageApp.py and SyntheticApp.py to CommonApp.py.
(6) ImageApp.py, SyntheticApp.py, and CommonApp.py should be in separate folders.
