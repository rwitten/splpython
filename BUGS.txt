Try to keep this up to date:

(0) It looks like the SSVM is getting solved now.  And I can sometimes get the
objective to go down between outer iterations.  But latent variable imputation
doesn't seem to improve objective.  Worth looking into if this continues to be
a problem after we run on real data.
(1) No command line processing at all. (This should be modded out, so both
train.py and eventually test.py can use the same command line args)
(1a) No writing things to disk.
(1b) No test.py (but I think after 1 and 1a this should be easy)
(2) We should make the boundary between the API (things in the basedir) and
things in 'implementation/' more clear, which can do simply by changing the
includes. If this doesn't make sense to you, don't worry about it at all.
(3) params shouldn't have access to examples because examples is mutable.
Right?
(4) The caching is a little bit wrong for psi - caching should only depend on
LV and we should make the right psi vector based on what we have (agreed).
(5) Need to make psi computation much faster (only doing once per image-LV
pair would probably help.).
(6) I restricted number of y's and h's considered, temporarily.
(7) Need to eventually add in SPL.
