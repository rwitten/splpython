Try to keep this up to date:

(0) Need constraint-dropping.
(1) Need AP scores.
(2) Need SPL, SPL+, SPL++.
(3) Need more graceful handling of user input.
(4) Need more elegant way to decide which application to use (currently ExampleLoader.py does this with an if-block).
(5) Maybe could move more code from ImageApp.py and SyntheticApp.py to CommonApp.py.
